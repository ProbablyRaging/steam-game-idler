# Download
All the latest versions of SGI can be downloaded from the [releases page](https://github.com/ProbablyRaging/steam-game-idler/releases)

SGI comes bundled as both a portable `.exe`[ยน](https://github.com/ProbablyRaging/steam-game-idler#notes) and an installable `.msi` for your choosing. While the portable version should work on most systems running the latest version of Win10 or Win11, the installer version comes bundled with all dependencies and should work on all versions of Windows making it the recommended method. Check the [notes](https://github.com/ProbablyRaging/steam-game-idler#notes) for more details.

SGI also comes in a `lite` version which doesn't require entering a Steam username or ID64 and relies soley on entering a game ID to work.

> [!Note]
> **PORTABLE VERSION** *[WebView2](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/webview2/?form=MA13LH#download-section) required. On Windows 10 (Version 1803 and later with all updates applied) and Windows 11, the WebView2 runtime is distributed as part of the operating system. Use the MSI installer if you're unsure, as it comes bundled with all dependencies.*
